# Password-Generator

## DESCRIPTION

This weeks assignment we were tasked with creating a web based application that generated a random password.  
The actual application was coded using javascript.  The random password is generated when the user clicks on a button and then a function
outputs or displays the randomly created password into the display box.

This application was a great homework assignment to kick off javascript.  This assignment invoked me to create a javascript file and incorporate things such as; declaring variables, use of functions, use of conditions, and invoking functions to run code declared in the functions. Also, we coded prompts and confirms to ask the user for their preference for their random password characters.

Although, I was unable to actually display the final password in the display box from my code, I leared quite a bit.  All of my code actually works (prompts, and confirms) except the last piece of it.  I learned how to psuedo code to pre-plan or outline my javascript file and how to structure the javascript for this assignment.

Furthermore, I think this was a great assignment to kick off javascript and now know areas in which I need to allocate more time to learning aspects of Java in which I do not feel comfortable.
